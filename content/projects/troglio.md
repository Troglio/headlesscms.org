# Power your apps and websites from Trello

**Troglio** turns any Trello board into a headless **CMS** : connect any site or app to manage its content from Trello cards.

Writers can write using **markdown**, **TOML** or the Custom Fields Power-up to author their content from anywhere, **even offline !**

Developers can use data as they please without being tied to a provider or a database.

This results in amazing collaborations between authors and developers offering literally no limits to what can be built.
